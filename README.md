## Integration to Github API
In this repo I use the Github API to return users data and build a simple profile from that connection

## Run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Install`
After all, use <b>npm i</b> to install all project dependencies.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## What I used
To build this project, I used react js with create-react-app starter-kit and styled-component.
